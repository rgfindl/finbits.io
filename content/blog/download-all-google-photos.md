# Learn how to download all your Google Photos

Are you terrified about loosing all your Google Photos?  Me too!

Here are the 3 ways you can download and backup all your precious memories.

## 1.) Using PhotosDownloader

This is an app I built to help you download all your Google Photos.  

It organizes them into "year/month" folders for easy access.

It performs an initial download of all your Google Photos, then incremental downloads to fetch new images and videos.

You can download it here [OSX](/downloads/photosdownloader-0.1.1.dmg) and here [WIN](/downloads/photosdownloader-0.1.1.exe).

The app is really simple.  Just grant permission to your Google Photos account and click download.  The app is 100% client side.  Nothing leaves your machine.

Another great feature is that you can download from multiple Google Photos accounts.  I also download and backup my wife's Google Photos.

You can also view the history of all your downloads.

## 2.) Using Google Drive

From Google: [Download photos or videos to your device](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7652919?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)

- On your computer, go to [drive.google.com](drive.google.com).
- Click Settings.

- Select Create a Google Photos folder checkbox.

- In My Drive, find the new Google Photos folder.
- Right click on the folder and select Download.

Once you have your Google Photos folder in Drive you can also use [Backup & Sync](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987) to download the Google Photos folder.

Adding your Google Photos folder to Drive is not supposed to consume your Drive storage quota.  

I tried this and it worked but it downloaded all the files into a single folder.  It also doesn't work well with multiple Google Photos accounts.

## 3.) Using Google Takeout

You can export any or all of your Google stuff via [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com).  

I tried this but it emailed me 200+ zip files to download :(

That's it.  I hope this helps you download all your Google Photos.
